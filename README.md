Color Detection System (CDS)


This system is designed to recognise several different colours and is based on simple image process technique that analyzes and extracts a colour of an image. In fact, the purpose of this project is to detect moving object while they appearing in front of a camera; however, the system is entirely based on the usage of colours that will help in the process of recognition of an object. The system is programmed to gather a sequence of snapshots with the help of a camer. Then, the recognition process will be carried with a particular technique that will be focuses on analyses the colour of the shots taken. Thus, a real-time computer vision system will be produced to be able to recognize colours on a moving object. Once a colour has been recognized the software is programmed to trigger a particular action. In this case the action will be to display a predesigned object profile. Nevertheless, this system will be a base to create a system capable of recognising the actual moving object without underestimates the usefulness of the colours.
